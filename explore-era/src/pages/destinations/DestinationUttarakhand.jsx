            When it comes to river rafting, Rishikesh is the most popular

            <br />
            The main stretch of white water rafting starts from Kaudilaya and
            ends at Laxman Jhula, consisting of 13 major rapids and taking 8-9
            hours. The course is dotted with several whirlpools and crosses

          </h2>
          <p className="main-info-details">
            Rightly called Devbhoomi, meaning, the land of the gods, Uttarakhand
            is where the spiritual aura is prominent. The state is home to a
            large number of Hindu temples that are situated in its remote
            corners. There are several holy rivers like the River Ganga which
            make it a sacred pilgrimage destination as well. Haridwar is one of

            religious attraction in Uttarakhand. <br />
            <br />
            The Kumbh Mela is held in Haridwar in Uttarakhand once every 12
            years. The state is also home to the Panch Badri, Panch Kedar and
            Panch Prayag. All of these are important pilgrimage destinations for
            Hindus and attract a large number of devotees each year. Each of
            these places are also associated with the mythologies in Hinduism,
            and hence, are extremely significant spiritually for the Hindus.
            These religious places are also blessed with spectacular natural
            beauty, so you can also enjoy the surreal beauty of Uttarakhand
            along with a spiritual experience. <br />
            <br />
            Panch Badri is a total of 5 holy places where Lord Badri, a form of
            Lord Vishnu is worshipped under 5 different names, which are: Vishal
            Badri (Badrinath), Yogdhan Badri, Bhavishya Badri, Vridha Badri and
            Adi Badri. All of these religious destinations are visited by a
            large number of devotees of Lord Vishnu from all across the country.
            Badrinath Temple is the main temple of Lord Vishnu, and is one of
            the four Chota Char Dham pilgrimage sites in Uttarakhand. It is
            situated at an elevation of almost 10,279 feet. The presiding deity
            is Lord Vishnu, who has a black granite statue in the temple. The
            deity is believed by Hindus to be one of the eight self manifested
            deities of Lord Vishnu. <br />
            <br />
            Panch Kedar, which comprises five temples, are located in the

            Lord Shiva, and attract devotees of Lord Shiva as well as other
            tourists from all over the country. There are also mentioned in
            several mythologies in Hinduism, one of which links their origins to
            the Pandavas, the heroes of the Indian epic, Mahabharata. <br />
            <br />
            Uttarakhand is also the holy land of Panch Prayag, which refers to
            the Five Confluences which occur at Vishnu Prayag, Nanda Prayag,
            Karn Prayag, Devprayag and Rudraprayag, to form the River Ganga. The
            Panch Prayag is respected by millions of Hindus because it is one of
            the holiest confluences in India, after Allahabad. It is believed
            that taking a dip in the confluences cleanses the body, mind and
            spirit, and takes an individual closer to mukti or liberation.{" "}
            <br />
            <br />
            The famous Char Dham Yatra is a major pilgrimage for Hindus in

            Waterfalls: Serene and great for a picnic!
          </h2>
          <p className="main-info-details">
            Waterfalls in Uttarakhand, are the beautiful places from where you
            can frame a perfect picture of water descending from a height with
            the gushing sound of water. And that's not all because the picture
            can never be complete without the mighty snow-capped peaks of
            Uttarakhand, painted in the background. Most of these charismatic
            waterfalls are perfect for a short trek, away from the busy tourist
            attractions in Uttarakhand, whereas there are few like the Kempty
            Falls in Mussoorie that remain unbelievably crowded throughout the
            year. Most of these falls have an average height of 126 m and are
            situated at an approximate elevation of 1400 m above the sea level.{" "}
            <br />
            <br />
            One of the best things about these waterfalls is that they add more
            charm to the nearby cities and towns like Mussoorie, Haridwar,
            Pithoragarh, Rishikesh giving visitors another reason to plan a
            holiday here. These small yet dreamy falls in Mussoorie are a
            delight if you are looking for a peaceful retreat away from the
            city.
            <br />
            <br />
            Another must visit waterfall is the Mossy Falls, which gets its name
            from the covering of mossy that envelopes the whole area making the
            place look even beautiful. Jimi Ghat Waterfalls in the Pithoragarh
            District is another popular waterfall which offers scintillating
            views of the Nanda Devi range, and is surrounded by the
            rhododendrons and birch.
