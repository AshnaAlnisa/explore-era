            Panch Prayag. All of these are important pilgrimage destinations for
            Hindus and attract a large number of devotees each year. Each of
            these places are also associated with the mythologies in Hinduism,

            beauty, so you can also enjoy the surreal beauty of Uttarakhand
            along with a spiritual experience. <br />

            the Pandavas, the heroes of the Indian epic, Mahabharata. <br />
            <br />
            Uttarakhand is also the holy land of Panch Prayag, which refers to
            the Five Confluences which occur at Vishnu Prayag, Nanda Prayag,
            Karn Prayag, Devprayag and Rudraprayag, to form the River Ganga. The
            Panch Prayag is respected by millions of Hindus because it is one of
            the holiest confluences in India, after Allahabad. It is believed
            that taking a dip in the confluences cleanses the body, mind and
            spirit, and takes an individual closer to mukti or liberation.{" "}
            <br />
            <br />

            Falls in Mussoorie that remain unbelievably crowded throughout the
            year. Most of these falls have an average height of 126 m and are
            situated at an approximate elevation of 1400 m above the sea level.{" "}
            <br />
            <br />
            One of the best things about these waterfalls is that they add more
            charm to the nearby cities and towns like Mussoorie, Haridwar,
            Pithoragarh, Rishikesh giving visitors another reason to plan a
            holiday here. These small yet dreamy falls in Mussoorie are a
            delight if you are looking for a peaceful retreat away from the
            city.
            <br />
            <br />
            Another must visit waterfall is the Mossy Falls, which gets its name
            from the covering of mossy that envelopes the whole area making the
            place look even beautiful. Jimi Ghat Waterfalls in the Pithoragarh
            District is another popular waterfall which offers scintillating
            views of the Nanda Devi range, and is surrounded by the
            rhododendrons and birch.
