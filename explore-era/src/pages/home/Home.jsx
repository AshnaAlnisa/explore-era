                The best time to visit India for holidays depends on the type of
                experience you seek. The tourism season in India varies across
                regions due to its diverse climate. The peak tourism season in
                India starts from September to June. For wildlife enthusiasts,
                winter is ideal as national parks are open, and wildlife
                sightings are abundant. Hill stations are most enjoyable during
                summer to escape the scorching heat of the plains. For trekking
                and hiking adventures, winter, monsoon, autumn, and spring offer
                pleasant weather. Plan your trip according to your preferences,
                and you'll discover India's incredible beauty and cultural
