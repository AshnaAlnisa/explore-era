          <h3>Weekend Getaways from Delhi</h3>
          <p>
            With its strategic location, Delhi finds no dearth of weekend
            getaway options. The national capital is neighbours with the
            Himalayan states of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, so even a
            holiday in a hill station is only a few hours drive away. Delhi is
            also flanked by Agra, which means, you only need a weekend trip to
            see Taj Mahal. The royal state of Rajasthan also shares a border
            with Delhi, opening the world full of opportunities to enjoy rich
            heritage, architecture, wildlife, and food that too on just a
            weekend tour. <br />
            <br />
            Whether you’re looking for a long or short family trip or a romantic
            getaway as a couple or an adventurous holiday, we have the best
            destinations to visit near Delhi within 100 km, 200 km, and 300 km.{" "}
