        <h2>Chadar Trek:</h2>
        <p>
          Chadar trek or frozen river trek, it is one of most challenging trek
          with an ultimate experience. Frozen river trek means you have to walk
          down frozen zanskar river. The traditional name of the trek is "Chadar
          trek" the frozen sheet, which was only way in and out for Zanskaris in
          winter when all other ways are closed due to heavy snow fall at high
          passes. Therefore, it had been trade route for centuries for Zanskari
          People. Now the route is also famous as winter trekking among
          adventure lovers. For last several years, we have been organizing this
          winter trek in three different options with trained local Zanskari
          potters and our well-experienced guide and staff.
