              Christianity is one of the religions that is not originated in
              India, but has a glorious relationship with the country and its
              people. The legend behind the introduction of Christianity in
              India states that in AD 52, St. Thomas sailed from Eastern Asia
              and was first to convert many Indians into Christians. After
              showing many miracles in Tamil Nadu and Kerala and evangelizing
              Indians, he is still worshiped as a martyred saint in Madras and
              was buried in the San Thomé Cathedral's site. In the earlier days,
              many Roman Catholic missionaries especially the Portuguese
              directed by the Jesuit Saint Francis Xavier entered the west coast
              from their bases in order to convert many natives to Christians.
              Starting from the eighteenth century, missionaries continued their
              work throughout the country and lead to the formation and growth
              of many Christian communities. <br /> <br />
              Surprisingly, even today the undecayed body of Saint Francis
              Xavier is available for public view in a coffin made of glass that
              is placed in Goa at the Basilica of Bom Jesus. Starting from the
              eighteenth century to the present time, one can witness the growth
              of a variety of Christian communities.

            <h4>Jesus Christ- The Central Figure Of Christianity</h4>
            <p>
              Christianity worships Jesus and regards him as the awaited Messiah
              of the Old Testament. Born in Bethlehem of Judea in 4.B.C, Jesus
              Christ lived as an ordinary carpenter in Nazareth until he turned
              30. After that, he lived an active public life for almost three
              years. During those years, Jesus taught the people that God is a
              merciful Father and insisted people to show their love towards god
              by loving their fellowmen without any restriction or difference.
              With his exceptional preaching, he became a revolutionary figure
              for many Jewish religious leaders.
            </p>
            <h4>The Bible- The Holy Book Of the Christians</h4>
            <p>
              The holy book of the Christians, Bible is believed to be written
              under the inspiration and guidance of God. It has two main parts
              i.e. "The Old Testament" and "The New Testament". The Old
              Testament has 46 books within it and presents the beliefs of the
              early Christian church. It also provides the detailed history of
              Jewish people who lived approximately 2000 years before Christ. On
              the other hand, The New Testament has 27 books in it and presents
              the preaching and life of Jesus Christ, his death and rebirth, the
              escalation of Christianity in the early years along with Apostles'
              message sent to different churches.
